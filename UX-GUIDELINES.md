# UX-GUIDELINES.md

A reference for expected user experience and interaction patterns in the e-commerce frontend. Aligns with [PRD.md](./PRD.md), [TECH-SPEC.md](./TECH-SPEC.md), and [TASKS.md](./TASKS.md).

## 1. Design Principles

- **Clarity:** Prioritize clear information hierarchy, legible typography, and intuitive controls. Avoid clutter; every element must serve a purpose.
- **Responsiveness:** All pages and components must adapt smoothly to mobile, tablet, and desktop. Touch targets must be accessible on all devices.
- **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and ensure keyboard navigation. Maintain sufficient color contrast and provide alt text for images.
- **Consistency:** UI components (buttons, cards, forms) must follow a unified style (shadcn/ui + TailwindCSS). Navigation, feedback, and actions should behave predictably across the app.

## 2. Global Navigation

- **Navbar:**
  - Fixed at the top, visible on all pages.
  - Includes links to Product Listing, Shopping Cart, and (optionally) brand/logo.
  - Cart icon displays current item count (updates in real time).
  - On mobile, use a hamburger menu or collapsible navigation.
- **Page Transitions:**
  - Use fast, non-blocking transitions. Show loading indicators for data fetches.
- **Persistent Cart Icon:**
  - Always accessible; clicking navigates to the Shopping Cart page.

**Related Tasks:**

- Implement responsive Navbar with navigation links and cart icon [TASKS.md]

---

## 3. Product Listing Page

- **Grid Layout:**
  - Use a responsive grid (2â€“4 columns depending on screen size).
  - Each product card shows image, name, price, and is clickable.
- **Filters & Search:**
  - Search bar at top; filters (e.g., category) are prominent and easy to reset.
  - Filter/search updates product list in real time (no full page reload).
- **Pagination:**
  - Controls at bottom or top-right; clearly indicate current page.
- **Loading States:**
  - Use skeleton loaders for product cards while fetching.
  - Show spinner for full-page loads.
- **Error States:**
  - Display a friendly error message with a retry button if products fail to load.

**Related Tasks:**

- Product grid/list, search bar, category filters, pagination, loading/error UI [TASKS.md]

---

## 4. Product Details Page

- **Content Layout:**
  - Large product image on left (desktop) or top (mobile).
  - Name, price, and description clearly visible.
  - Prominent "Add to Cart" button.
- **Add-to-Cart Flow:**
  - On click, provide immediate feedback (e.g., button animates, toast notification, or cart icon updates).
  - Prevent duplicate adds or allow quantity increment (per requirements).
- **Loading Behavior:**
  - Use skeletons for image and text while loading.
  - Show error fallback with retry if fetch fails.

**Related Tasks:**

- Product details layout, add-to-cart button, loading/error UI [TASKS.md]

---

## 5. Shopping Cart Page

- **Item List:**
  - Each item: thumbnail, name, price, remove button.
  - (Optional) Quantity controls for future extensibility.
- **Remove Flow:**
  - Remove button provides instant feedback (item disappears, total updates).
  - Confirm removal with undo option (toast/snackbar) for better UX.
- **Total Amount:**
  - Clearly display total at bottom or top of cart list.
- **Empty Cart Handling:**
  - Show a friendly empty state (icon, message, link to browse products).

**Related Tasks:**

- Cart item list, remove functionality, total display, empty cart state [TASKS.md]

---

## 6. Empty States

- **No Products:**
  - If data is being fetched, show a loading spinner. If no products are available after fetch, show a message and illustration.
- **No Search Results:**
  - If searching, show spinner while fetching. If no results, display a clear message (e.g., "No products found for your search.") and a reset search button.
- **Empty Cart:**
  - If cart data is loading, show spinner. If empty, show friendly message, icon, and a call-to-action to return to product listing.

**Related Tasks:**

- Ensure empty states for product list, search, and cart [TASKS.md]
- _Suggest adding explicit tasks for empty state illustrations/messages if not present._

---

## 7. Loading & Error Feedback

- **Spinners & Skeletons:**
  - Use skeleton loaders for content blocks (cards, details) and spinners for full-page or blocking actions.
- **Fallback UI:**
  - Show clear, actionable error messages ("Something went wrong. [Retry]").
- **Retry Flows:**
  - Always provide a retry button for failed fetches.
- **Global Feedback:**
  - Use [sonner](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/sonner) (from shadcn/ui) for toast/snackbar notifications (success, error, etc) for cart actions and errors.

**Related Tasks:**

- Global loading and error UI components [TASKS.md]
- _Suggest adding tasks for toast/snackbar notifications if not present._

---

## 8. Additional UX Recommendations

- **Focus Management:**
  - Move focus to main content on navigation for accessibility.
- **Touch Feedback:**
  - Buttons and interactive elements should have visible pressed/active states.
- **Visual Hierarchy:**
  - Use consistent spacing, font sizes, and color for clarity.

## 9. Suggested TASKS.md Additions

- [ ] Add explicit tasks for empty state illustrations/messages for product list, search, and cart [UI]
- [ ] Add tasks for toast/snackbar notifications for cart actions and errors [UI]
- [ ] Add task for focus management on navigation for accessibility [UI]
