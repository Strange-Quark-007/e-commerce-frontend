Start implementing section 1 of tasks ie  Project Setup & Tooling

use pnpm and setup tailwind along with nextjs

---

**Cursor**

The Next.js setup with pnpm failed because the current directory (`e-commerce-frontend`) is not empty—it contains files and folders that could conflict with the new project initialization.

**Options to proceed:**
1. **Create the Next.js app in a new subdirectory** (recommended to keep your current files safe).
2. **Delete or move the existing files/folders** (`.cursor/`, `chats/`, `specs/`) if you want to initialize in the current directory (this will remove your current workspace files).
3. **Manually set up Next.js and Tailwind in the current directory** (advanced, but possible).

Which option would you like to proceed with? If you want to use a subdirectory, please provide a name (e.g., `web` or `frontend`). If you want to delete/move files, confirm that as well.

# E-Commerce Frontend

This project is a modern e-commerce frontend built with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, Zustand, and React Query.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v8+ recommended)

### Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   pnpm dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

### Included Tooling
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with TypeScript
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

### Project Structure
- `/src` — Main source code directory

---

For more details, see the `specs/` directory for requirements and technical documentation.

```

Section 1 (Project Setup & Tooling) is now fully implemented in the new `e-commerce` folder. Here’s what was completed:

- ✅ Next.js project initialized with TypeScript and `/src` structure (using pnpm)
- ✅ TailwindCSS installed and configured
- ✅ shadcn/ui installed and initialized
- ✅ ESLint set up with Next.js + TypeScript config
- ✅ Prettier installed and configured
- ✅ Zustand installed for state management
- ✅ React Query installed for data fetching
- ✅ Project README created with setup instructions

You can now start the development server by running:
```sh
cd e-commerce
pnpm dev
```

Would you like to proceed with the next section (State Management and Data Fetching Setup) or need any adjustments to the setup?

```shellscript
cd e-commerce
pnpm dev
```

Understood! Section 1 (Project Setup & Tooling) is complete, but you do not want to proceed to the next section yet.

If you need to:
