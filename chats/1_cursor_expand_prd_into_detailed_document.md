Act as a senior product manager.

You are given a high-level problem statement in the form of a basic PRD (attached as a Markdown file). Your task is to expand it into a more detailed and structured Product Requirements Document (PRD).

Create a new file called `PRD.md`.

Make sure to:
- Use clear and consistent section headings
- Add clarifying details where helpful, while staying concise
- Follow standard PRD structure: Purpose, Scope, Functional Requirements, Pages/Flows, Data/API, Deliverables
- Break each page or module into smaller features or user interactions
- Use bullet points and markdown formatting where appropriate
- Maintain a professional and focused tone

Only use information from the attached file. If anything is missing or unclear, request clarification before proceeding.
