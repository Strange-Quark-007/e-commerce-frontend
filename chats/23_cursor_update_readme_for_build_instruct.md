In the readme, mention about build step and starting production build locally

---

**Cursor**

```markdown
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app.

3. **Build for production:**
   ```sh
   pnpm build
   ```
   This will generate an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

4. **Start the production server locally:**
   ```sh
   pnpm start
   ```
   The app will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in production mode.

```

I've updated the README to include instructions for building the project and starting the production build locally. The new section explains how to run `pnpm build` to generate an optimized production build and `pnpm start` to serve it locally in production mode. Let me know if you want any further adjustments!
